The dataset includes 809 images.
Cucumber-snake are annotated in folder format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -45 and +45 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
